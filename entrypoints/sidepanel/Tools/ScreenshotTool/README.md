## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The `useScreenshotState` hook manages all application state including:
- Image data and capture state
- Current editing mode and tool settings
- Annotations and selections
- UI state (modals, inputs)
- Image adjustment parameters

### Canvas Rendering
The `useCanvasDrawing` hook handles:
- Image rendering with applied adjustments
- Annotation drawing with proper styling
- Crop overlay visualization
- Selection indicators and control points

### User Interactions
The `useCanvasInteraction` hook manages:
- Mouse event handling for drawing and selection
- Annotation creation and manipulation
- Drag and drop functionality
- Tool-specific interaction behaviors

### Component Responsibilities

#### ToolBar
- Tool selection and visual feedback
- Screenshot capture initiation
- Clean, icon-based interface

#### PropertyPanel
- Color picker with preset colors
- Tool-specific property controls
- Image adjustment sliders
- Background style options (visual)
- Undo/clear actions

#### CanvasEditor
- Main editing surface
- Image display with adjustments applied
- Real-time annotation preview
- Mode indicators and crop information

#### StatusBar
- Image dimensions and selection info
- Primary action buttons
- Keyboard shortcut indicators

## Styling

The tool uses a modern dark theme with:
- **Primary Colors**: Gray-900 background, white text
- **Accent Color**: Blue-600 for active states and selections
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states and smooth transitions
- **Typography**: Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins throughout

## Browser Compatibility

The tool is built with modern web standards and requires:
- Chrome/Edge 88+ (for Clipboard API)
- Firefox 87+ (for Clipboard API)
- Safari 13.1+ (for Clipboard API)

## Performance Considerations

- Canvas operations are optimized for smooth interaction
- Image adjustments use CSS filters when possible
- State updates are batched to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Large images are automatically scaled for performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Layer system for complex compositions
- More annotation types (callouts, stamps)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Cloud storage integration
- Collaboration features
- Advanced image filters
- Vector graphics support
